Description: Biodiversity is a multifaceted concept covering different levels of organization from
            genes to ecosystems. 'iNEXT.scaling' extends 'iNEXT' to estimate Hill numbers (also called taxonomic diversity)
            under sampling without replacement model. This package provides functions to compute standardized 
            taxonomic diversity estimates with a common sample size or sample coverage. 
            The package features size- and coverage-based rarefaction and extrapolation 
            sampling curves to facilitate rigorous comparison across individual assemblages. 
            Asymptotic diversity estimates are also provided.
